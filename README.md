Notes for fast.ai's [deep learning course, part 1, 2018 edition](http://course.fast.ai/).

initial setup:
- setup a gpu enabled cloud pc on [paperspace](http://paperspace.com/)
- paperspace is super easy to use and cheaper than Amazon's EC2
- downside is that the closest paperspace region is far away from me, so I setup a EC2 g2.xlarge instance using Amazon's [Deep Learning AMI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dlami/latest/devguide/what-is-dlami.html). p2.xlarge is newer/faster but was 1.55 vs 0.9.
